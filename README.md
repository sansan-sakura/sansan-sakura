 #                      Hej!  I'm Sakura.


-  🤖 I am a curious human being who loves to learn new things. Leaning is my best hobby but I also love to be in nature with my children ⛺️
-  🦔 I believe in Scrates's quote 'I know that I know nothing', therefore I like to ask myself always "Why" to at least understand/know a bit more.
